            This past semester I started on my senior design project.
            The goal of the project is to build a system that can track employees
            in an indoor or outdoor setting. Then, with the hololens, display others
            in real time in an augmented reality environment.

            My role in the team is of the Software Architect. I help the team
            with choosing the best way to connect our different services and
            systems to create a platform that is scalable as well as easy to
            integrate with. I also take on DevOps roles so that the project has 
            a solid CI/CD pipeline to deliver the fastest and best product to our
            customer.
